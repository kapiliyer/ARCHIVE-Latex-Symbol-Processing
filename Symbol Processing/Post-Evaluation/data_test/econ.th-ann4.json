    "text": "\\paragraph{Survey of French Bakers}\nTo better understand how firms incorporate fairness into their pricing decisions , we interviewed 31 bakers in France in 2007 .\nThe French bread market makes a good case study because the market is large ; bakers set their prices freely ; and French people care enormously about bread .\n\\footnote{In 2005, bakeries employed 148,000 workers, for a yearly turnover of            billion euros (\\url{https://perma.cc/V679-UFE8} ) .\nSince 1978 , French bakers have been free to set their own prices , except during the inflationary period 1979 -- 1987 when price ceilings and growth caps were imposed .\nFor centuries , bread prices caused major social upheaval in France .\n\\ct[p.~35]{M99} explains that before the French Revolution , `` affordable bread prices underlay any hopes for urban tranquility . ''\nDuring the Flour War of 1775 , mobs chanted `` if the price of bread does not go down , we will exterminate the king and the blood of the Bourbons ' ' ; following these riots , `` under intense pressure from irate and nervous demonstrators , the young governor of Versailles had ceded and fixed the price ` in the King 's name ' at two sous per pound , the mythohistoric just price inscribed in the memory of the century ''\n\\cp[p.~12]{K96} . }\nWe sampled bakeries in Aix - en - Provence , Grenoble , Paimpol , and Paris .\nThe interviews reveal that bakers are guided by norms of fairness when they adjust prices to preserve customer loyalty .\nIn particular , cost - based pricing is widely used .\nBakers only raise the price of bread in response to increases in the cost of flour , utilities , or wages .\nThey refuse to increase prices in response to increased demand --- during weekends , during the summer tourist season , or during the holiday absences of local competitors .\nBakers explained that pricing otherwise would be unfair , and hence would anger and drive away customers ."

Traders' expectations therefore take the form of a weighted average of naive beliefs and correct beliefs. The two rules differ in that consumers in our model average naive beliefs with a particular form of incorrect beliefs (proportional inference); to include rational updating as a limit case, we calibrate the updating rule to match correct equilibrium beliefs for the case in which all consumers are rational. We adopt this approach for its tractability.}"
