    "text": "The simulation results for the gamma - radiation properties above the photon energy of 1 MeV are shown in Fig. ~ \\ref{spectrum} .\nThe applied parameters are the following : the peak intensity of the 4 - cycle laser pulse is $I\\approx 4.9\\times 10^{23}$ W / cm $^2$ ( $\\xi=600$ ) , the laser wavelength $\\lambda_0 = 1$ $\\mu$ m , and the laser beam waist size $w_0$ = 1 $\\mu$ m .\nThe initial kinetic energy of the electrons is $200$ MeV ( $\\gamma_0=392$ , $\\chi_{max}\\approx0.8$ ) .\nAs the electron reflection condition should hold in the laser field , larger initial electron energies $\\gamma_0>\\xi/2$ are required because of radiation losses .\nWe employ an electron bunch of length $L_b=10\\lambda_0$ , and of transverse size $w_b=w_0$ , with the number of electrons $N_e=3\\times 10^{8}$ .\nThe energy as well as angular spread of the bunch are $\\Delta \\gamma/\\gamma_0=\\Delta \\theta=10^{-3}$ .\n\\begin{figure}"
